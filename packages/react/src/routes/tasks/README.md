# Tasks
Create a task management application using React. Implement the following features:
- Use the Context API and useReducer to manage the global state of tasks.
- The global state should include an array of tasks, where each task has an id, title, and completed status.
- Implement actions to add a new task, remove a task, and toggle the completion status of a task.
- Create a TaskProvider component to provide the task state and dispatch functions to the rest of the application.
- Create a TaskList component to display the list of tasks.
- Create a TaskForm component to add new tasks.
- Use the useContext hook in your components to access the task state and dispatch functions.
